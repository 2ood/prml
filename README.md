# About

We run [__2022 PRML Seminar__](https://www.notion.so/2022-PRML-Seminar-2b86ae409d124649803aa6f28a595edd) in which we study Bishop's book to search for theoretical understanding of machine learning. Slides, additional notes, and sample codes are uploaded in [here](https://www.notion.so/2022-PRML-Seminar-2b86ae409d124649803aa6f28a595edd). This repository contains slides and sample codes with modifications. We use github to enable efficient co-working and code refactorization. Code will be refactorized in irregular manner. 


Topics visited
--------------

We have studied the following concepts.

* Basics of machine learning
  - We have discussed about minimization via gradient descent, variants of gradient descents(stochastic gradient descent, mini-batch gradient descent), and backpropagation.
* Linear models for regression
  - We have discussed regression via basis function, learning via maximum-log-likelihood and sequence learning.
* Neural Networks
  - We have discussed backpropagation and auto-diff in mathematical manner.
* Kernel Methods
  - We have discussed mathematical motivations of kernel methods, dual representation, Gaussian process, and regression via Gaussian process.

Topics to be visited
--------------------

In the upcomming sessions, we will discuss the followings.

* Sparse kernel machines, graphical models, approximate inference, and sampling methods. (Specific topics, presenters, and dates TBD.)
